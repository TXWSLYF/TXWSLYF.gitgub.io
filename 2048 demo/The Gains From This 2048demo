1.Difference between Element.value and Element.getAttribute(“value”)

.value does not map to any attribute.
.defaultValue maps to the "value" attribute. So when you say elem.getAttribute("value") that's the same as elem.defaultValue.
Additionally, .defaultValue reflects .value when the input is untouched (dirty value flag is false). After the input's value is changed 
by user interaction, this mapping stops. While the input is untouched, you can change .defaultValue (and thus .setAttribute("value")) 
and see it change .value as well. Not that this is practically useful but interesting piece of trivia nevertheless.
